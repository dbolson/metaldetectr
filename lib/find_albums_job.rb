Lists are all fine and good, but what I'm looking for is something that will tell me only about the 2-3 dozens of bands that I care about.
Wading through humongous columns of names, 99% of which I've never heard of or don't care about, is pretty annoying to do regularly (Yep,
I'm lazy, big surprise).

EDIT: They have it! Well, almost. At New Releases there's an RSS feed with artists that either (a) you've listened to at some point or
(b) their algorithm recommends you. Not customisable, unfortunately, but still pretty good.
